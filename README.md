# aisdecode

## Introduction
AISdecode is a simple app to convert one type of AIS data to another. It is generally useful for mining large datasets of raw AIS data e.g. saved as .csv or .nmea files and saving relevent data (e.g. between certain times or within a geographic area) to more user readable format such as an sqlite database or MATLAB files. AISdecode was desinged to be extensible i.e. it can implement as many input and output data types as are needed.
